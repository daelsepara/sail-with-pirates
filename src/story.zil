<CONSTANT TEXT001 "You're standing in the hot Caribbean sun in New Providence, the Bahama Islands. It's April 26, 1684.||\"Hey, Lucky!\" A man gets up from the sand under a palm tree and waves in your direction. He must mean you, because you're the only one around.||He walks up painfully, leaning on a rough crutch made from a tree branch. \"You got out of here just in time, Lucky Century, afore the Spanish come to burn us down.\"||Who is Lucky Century? you wonder.||\"What did you come back here for, anyway?\" He looks at you with a puzzled grin. \"Don't you remember me -- Hiram Robertson?\"||\"Well, uh...\" You explain that you want to sail with a Captain Phips.||\"Phips! Why, he's looking for sailors. Hurry on down to the harbor. He's about to sail!\"||You walk with Robertson, who asks strange questions about a ship called the Timely and about pirates. He seems surprised that you don't understand.||The town is a mess. People are replacing damaged roofs and doors in the few houses still left standing.||\"There's Phips now,\" says Robertson. \"Oh, Captain!\" A tall, powerful-looking man stares you up and down.||\"A little young to put to sea,\" he finally says.||\"I may be young,\" you say, \"but I'm eager! I want to learn everything there is to know about sailing.\"||\"All right, sailor, but listen here: we're after sunken treasure. Plenty for everyone if we find it, but no pay at all if we don't. Hard biscuits and salt beef, rough weather and too much sun.\"||\"That's fine with me,\" you tell him.||\"Where's Jim Teal?\" the captain calls. He tips the man with a crutch for finding you. A boy about thirteen puts down a barrel and runs up. The captain waves his hand at the web of ropes hanging from the nearest ship's masts. \"Teal,\" he says, \"show our new hand the ropes.\"||\"Glad to, Cap'n Phips!\" Teal grins at you. \"This way,\" he says, taking your arm at the elbow.||He pinches it hard as soon as the captain has his back turned.||\"Now listen here, Century,\" he hisses in your ear. \"I'll show you the ropes, all right. If you cross me I'll see you hang from one of 'em! You do what I say -- no back talk. When I say jump, you jump! You understand?\"||You look this guy straight in the eye and nod. Why is he so nasty? And why does everybody here think they know you? Well, you decide, if they're all going to call you Lucky Century, you might as well use that name.||As Teal explains the ship's routine, the ship turns and points out to sea. The strongest sailors pull the anchor cable up by winding it around a wheel called a capstan.||\"Weigh ho, away! Haul away, my Rosie,\" the sailors sing. With each O sound they give the capstan a push. \"Weigh ho away, haul away Joe.\"||The captain rings a brass bell on top of the forecastle when the anchor lifts off the bottom. Sailors waiting far up the masts let the sails fall when they hear the bell. The square sails fill out with wind.||You glide out to sea, part of the crew of the Rose of Algeree.">

The big white church is brand-new now, and the bell tower is firmly in place.||Long lines of mules carrying heavy leather bags wind down the hills from Mexico City. In the plaza sits a mountain of silver in bars, plates, and bags. Men load it onto ships bit by bit. You go up to an official watching over the loading.||\"Is this all the silver going to Spain?\"||\"Is this all? You joke! This is just the tail of the donkey.\" Something about his voice is familiar -- yes! It's Francisco Granillo. A younger man now, and of course he doesn't recognize you -- he's never met you before!||\"The king's silver,\" he continues, \"is split between the lead ship, the San Pedro y San Pablo, and the rear ship, Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion. Then there are thirty more merchant ships with silver. How much silver? On the Concepcion alone there are four million pesos! One hundred and forty tons!\"||He looks at you carefully. \"With so many ships, we need many sailors. You know the sea? We could use you aboard the Concepcion.\"||Perfect! That's the ship whose eventual grave you're here to find. You agree immediately and ride out to the galleon on a boat so loaded with silver it barely clears the waves.|| You sail on the Concepcion across the Gulf of Mexico toward Havana, Cuba. The voyage takes almost a month. It's hard to imagine that this whole ship, so full of life, will soon sink under the waves. But not yet -- up ahead is Cuba, and soon you'll be exploring the biggest Spanish port in the Indies: Havana.">

Calico Joe rakes in his money with a laugh. \"Pull up a stool, my lucky matey, and have yourself a drink!\"||You learn that the sailors all come from a ship called the Sea Hawk moored a few yards away. \"About time we paid a wee visit to the Spanish, don't you think, boys?\" says Calico Joe. The others pound the table in agreement.||\"Are you pirates?\" you ask.||\"Pirates?\" Calico Joe exclaims, laughing. \"No, mate, we're privateers! The English king gave us a paper what says we can raid the Spanish all we like. Hands off your English towns, but who cares? The Spanish have all the silver!\"||Suddenly the table flips over. The privateers go tumbling to the ground.||\"Get thee behind me, Satan!\" A stern man in black with a tall hat and carrying a Bible points a bony finger at the sprawling men. \"Thou lovest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men!\"||\"Ow,\" says Joe, stumbling to his feet. \"This new Puritan minis- ter is worse than the last one!\"||\"Look at you,\" says the Puritan. \"Grown men playing Satan's games! While your ship lies there idle and the shipworm eats its hull. And spreading your corruption to a mere child!\" He grabs you by the ear and drags you off.||\"The Devil smiles on an idle child,\" he says, hitting you over the head. He takes you down to a ship called the Morning Star. \"Put this youngster to work!\" he says to the captain, a stocky man named Broadstreet, and stalks off.||Broadstreet stares after him, amused.||\"He's not that bad a chap, really, but he's got a lot to learn.\" The captain puffs on his pipe. \"He acts as if he's in the other Puritan colony, up in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay. There the cold, cold winter puts the fear of God in you, sure.\" He looks you over. \"But if you'd like to help us load up, you're welcome.\"||You help load crates of lemons, limes, and other supplies on the Morning Star.

\"Buenos dias!\" says an old man, motioning you to sit down with him. \"I am Francisco Granillo. Sit down! No one should be out in the sun at siesta time. Why are you here?\"||\"I'm looking for the ships,\" you say. \"When will they load the treasure galleons?\"||\"Ho! You are too early. The ships come once a year. The rest of the time, Vera Cruz is a city of the shadows.\"||\"Don Francisco!\" A girl runs up shouting. \"A sail! The fleet has come!\" Suddenly the town comes alive. Men and women run down to the sea to watch. A dozen ships approach the harbor from the north.||Just as suddenly, the rejoicing stops. The smiles disappear. Old Francisco mutters under his breath.||\"What's wrong?\" you ask.||\"Those ships,\" he says slowly. \"They are not ours! They are French ships, and Hollanders.\"
\"What's wrong with the French?\"||He looks at you as if you're crazy. \"The French? They are pirates, of course!\" He shakes his head. \"They will destroy our town. In 1641, we destroyed the English raiders, in Providence. Now the raiders have returned! Once Spain was strong,\" he says sadly, \"but all empires must grow weak one day. Run for your life!\"||Longboats full of men waving pistols approach the shore. The people of Vera Cruz grab what they can carry from their houses and run for the hills. A cannonball hits the tower of the old white church, and the big bell comes crashing down.||You run as fast as you can. A storeroom door opens and a man runs out, carrying a very heavy bag. You jump through the open door, slam it shut, and crouch in the darkness. You can hear screams and shouts outside as the pirates destroy the town.||The door bangs open and a thin, bearded man runs in. He has a torch in one hand and a sword in the other.||\"Aha!\" he cries, throwing his torch to the floor and grabbing you. He twists your arm behind your back and puts his sword to your neck.||\"Where is the silver?\" he hisses in your ear. \"Tell me, quick!\" \"I -- I don't know. I'm just a visitor here!\"||\"Ha! You lie. Shall I give you a smile, a nice red smile, from ear to ear?\" He presses the sword harder against your throat.||A second pirate bursts in and surveys the room with his torch. \"Here it is!\" he shouts. The other end of the room is piled high with bars of silver gleaming in the torchlight \"Mark this down,\" the new pirate shouts. \"I claim all the silver in this room as my share of the plunder.\"||\"Not so fast, Grammont.\" The first pirate pushes you away and waves his sword. \"I was here first. This is mine.\"||\"And if, my dear Van Horn, this is the only silver storehouse?\" They both have their swords up now.||\"Then, gentle sir, I'm afraid you will be very sad. En garde!\" The pirates battle through the room.||Maybe it's time to be on the trail of your own silver. You could jump back in time to the year the Concepcion left for Spain -- 1641. Do you want to jump back to this same town, Vera Cruz, or to the island of Providence old Francisco spoke about?||The straw-covered floor smolders from the torches.

The ship is becalmed, lying motionless on a wide sea flat as glass.||\"Oh, me aching legs!\" says Calico Joe. He sits down next to you. His skin is oddly yellow, you notice, even though he's sunburned.||\"I don't know what's wrong with me,\" you say. \"I just don't feel like doing anything.\"||\"None of us has much wind in our sails, mate,\" says Joe with a weak grin. \"Let me have a look at your teeth.\" He pulls down your lip and runs his finger along your gums. It hurts!||\"A pretty fair set o' teeth you have,\" he says. \"I hope you get to keep 'em.\"||\"Keep them?\"||\"Hope so. Do they feel loose? If they do, you've got the scurvy, mate! All of us on board are gettin' it. And if the wind don't pick up soon, losing our teeth will just be the beginning. The scurvy can do a lot worse.\"||\"What causes scurvy?\" you ask.||\"It's the shipboard plague. Nobody knows what causes it. I got an idea it's something in the food, but I've been eating salt beef and sea biscuit all my life. You only get scurvy on long trips.\"||You don't want to lose your teeth! Maybe you should jump in time directly to the treasure ship's port.||You haven't had a piece of fruit or a fresh vegetable since you came on board; the ship left in an awful hurry. You remember the lemons you were loading on the other ship. You get a candle and go below the deck to see if anyone thought to store some on the Sea Hawk.||You open a barrel to look for lemons, and you feel something soft. It squeals. Rats! Huge gray rats are gnawing through the barrels, eating the food inside them. You jump back and drop your candle.||Now you can't see anything, but the room is filled with squealing sounds. The rats crawl on you, jumping on your shoulders. You throw them off, but they're everywhere! You could jump ahead in time to get away -- back to the port the silver ships left from.

If we can rig a new foresail, we can control the ship! Who will help me try?\"||\"It's no use,\" cries one man. \"And too dangerous!\" \"Dangerous?\" says another. \"Who cares? We are already dead men.\" You volunteer along with a few other sailors. To reach the foresail you must crawl across the slippery, sloping deck, so six of you tie yourselves together by the waist with a long rope. Several times you lose your footing and almost fall into the sea, but at last you manage to tie a piece of canvas to the dangling ropes. It's a desperate last chance -- but the ship comes about to point into the wind.||From the depths of despair the sailors raise a cheer.||\"Are we not sailors? Are we not proud Spaniards? Man the pumps!\"||For a day and a night you struggle to keep the ship afloat. On the second morning the sun breaks through the clouds.||The Concepcion is still afloat, but a ship with no main mast cannot go very fast. There are no Spanish ports nearby to seek help from. No one quite knows where the ship is, but Don Juan de Villavicencio, the admiral, decides to sail south to Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, that's at least a thousand miles away!||The ship limps along as best it can. One day you hear shouts coming from the admiral's cabin. Francisco Granillo comes storming out, gives a kick at a spare sail, and sits down with you.||\"Idiots!\" he exclaims. \"Those pilots! You know how they got their jobs?\" He rubs his fingers together. \"A little silver can buy many jobs. But it cannot buy the wisdom to do them well! They think we are due north from Puerto Plata. Turn south, they say. Caramba!\"||\"Where do you think we are?\"||\"At least three hundred miles to the west. Nombre de Dios! If we turn south now, we will hit the dangerous Handkercher Reef!\"||A few nights later, you're asleep in your hammock when a sudden jolt throws you to the floor.||SKREEEINK! You stumble about in the darkness, trying to find your clothes. Another terrible noise, and you're thrown against the wall. The ship is tilting. Which way out of here? You run across the wall -- into a pool of water! You grab your things and scramble up to the door.||A man rushes past you with a sword stuck through his chest. He collapses. There's only one lifeboat left on board, and the passengers are fighting over who will be in it.||Admiral de Villavicencio comes out of his cabin. \"Stop!\" he cries. \"We're on a reef. Firmly stuck, so we won't sink tonight. Wait until morning, and we'll build rafts for everyone!\"||You spend a cold, unpleasant night huddled on the deck above the waves. At dawn, the tide goes out, and the sailors groan at the sight of their ship. The stern is caught on two big rocks. The bow is already sunk beneath the sea. The remaining masts shoot out at a crazy angle. All around you are what look like the stumps of old trees: a dismal forest of coral.||Well, here you are. You not only found the wreck, you were riding on it when it hit the reef. When everyone has left, you can dive for treasure at your leisure.

We should sail our rafts east or southeast to land in Anegada.\"||A second sailor fiddles with the sextant. \"Yes, you are correct about the latitude,\" he says. \"But the best way to sail is southwest. A little farther, but we will reach Puerto Rico, where there are Spaniards to help us.\"||\"Give me that sextant,\" says another man. He makes his own cal- culations. \"We are between twenty degrees thirty minutes and twenty-one degrees. We must be in the Handkercher Reef!

I don't. Nobody does. The day sailors can figure that out, we'll be a lot safer!\"||Don Juan de Villavicencio believes the pilot and decides to sail southeast.

You could sign indentures -- be my servant for a couple years maybe, and so pay your debt for the ride.\" It doesn't seem like a very good deal, but you agree.||The boat is full of empty water kegs. You help Captain De Graaf load casks of water on the ship. They sure need a lot of water!||\"The cargo is thirsty,\" says De Graaf. \"Four thousand miles we are sailing from the Gold Coast. They drink like horses. Go below and give them water.\"||You hear a low moaning sound from below the deck. What kind of cargo is this ship transporting?||Halfway down the stairs, you stop.||You're on a slave ship! Men and women are chained up on racks so narrow they have no room to stand up. You go to them in turn, handing each a cup of water. Their heavy chains rattle as they take the cup. One man is so weak he can't even hold the cup. You hold his head and help him drink.||\"This other one's dead,\" says a sailor. \"And this one over here.\" They unchain the dead bodies, take them up on deck and throw them overboard. How can the sailors do this? They act as if they're carrying cows or sugar in the hold.||You have the worst trip you ever hope to have on the way to Jamaica. You try to help the poor Africans as much as you can, but you can't set them free. You hear their cries and groans everywhere you go. Every time you bring them food and water, you have to look away from the rows of frightened and angry eyes.||At Port Royal, the slaves are marched ashore. People passing by don't pay much attention -- it's just another cargo come from Africa. Men come to inspect the \"merchandise.\" They check the slaves' teeth and feel for broken bones.||One slave spits in a planter's face as he tries to check his teeth. Crack! goes the whip of a guard against his bare back.||Guards prod a few slaves up on top of a wooden platform.||\"Here's a fine selection!\" cries the auctioneer. \"Who will make me an offer for these prime specimens? Africa's best, gentlemen! Strong and agile.\"||\"Fifteen pounds a head,\" offers one man. \"Fifteen pounds Jamaican!\" scoffs the auctioneer. \"Gentlemen, are you going to let him get away with that? A steal at fifteen pounds! Fearsome warriors in their native jungle -- with a little seasoning they'll cut through sugarcane like a hurricane!\"||The poor slaves stand there in the hot sun. Some look angry, some scared and bewildered. How can people treat others this way?||\"You! Century!\" the slave-ship captain calls. He has your indenture papers in his hand. \"Here's the fellow,\" he says to a thin man in a white hat carrying a cane. \"A good worker, good with the slaves.\"||\"Century,\" he says to you, \"this is Master Throneberry. He's your new master now, for the next five years. Good luck.\"||So he's selling you, too -- until your indenture years are finished!">

He hands you a long, flat knife called a machete.||Other slaves and servants arrive, each carrying a machete. Sugarcane looks like giant grass. You hack at the thick stalks. They're hard to cut, even with the sharp machetes.||By the end of the day you're \"bone tired,\" as John calls it. He invites you to have dinner in the slaves' quarters. It's crowded but very clean and busy. John introduces you to his mother, father, and three sisters.||After dinner John takes you to a corner. He leans over and whispers. \"Century. My friend, right? Could you do me a big favor?\"||\"Sure,\" you say. He reaches under a pile of wood and brings out something hidden.||\"I seen you readin' that book you have with you.\" He looks at you eagerly. \"Could you teach me how to read? Please!\" He shows you his precious secret. It's an old-fashioned spelling book. \"Master, he don't want slaves to know nothin' except how to cut cane. But there's so much of the world I wants to know about! Here.\" He opens the book. \"That's an A, right? What's the rest of it say?\"||\"A is for the apple,\" you read, \"that Adam ate.\" There's a picture of Adam and Eve by a fruit tree in the Garden of Eden.||Suddenly the room is quiet. The door swings open, and Master Throneberry walks in, followed by a boss slave called the slavedriver. John quickly shuts his book and sits on it.||\"Well, John,\" says Throneberry, \"so we're having a little chat with our friend Century! What's that you're sitting on, John?\"||\"Nothin'.\"||\"Nothing? Why don't you stand up and let us see?\" He prods at John's leg with his cane.||\"Get up!\" the driver commands. \"You stand up when the Master asks you!\" John stands up slowly. Throneberry snatches the book.||\"Well, well. A spelling primer! Now what could that be doing in the slaves' quarters?\"||\"That book's mine!\" you say.||\"Yours! Well, you're my servant, so what's yours is mine.\" He walks over to the fireside, ripping pages from the book.||\"John, no!\" cries John's mother, as John runs across the room and plucks the book from the fire. Throneberry grabs him by the shoulder. John hits him across the face!||Throneberry steps back in amazement. The driver grabs John and drags him to a pile of logs.||\"You little devil!\" shouts Throneberry. \"You know the penalty for striking a white man!\" The driver holds John's arm against a log and picks up a machete.||\"Which hand was it, Master?\" the driver shouts.||\"The left.\"||\"Don't you worry none, Master. That hand ain't never going to strike you again!\" He raises the machete over John's hand. John twists and kicks.||You can't just let them cut his hand off! You run up and grab the machete from the driver's hand. \"Get out of here,\" you yell, waving the machete at Throneberry and his driver. \"Let him go and get out of here!\"||\"Well, Lucky Century,\" says Throneberry as he backs away. \"We'll see how lucky you are when I get through with you!\" You slam the door in his face.||\"You've got to run for the hills,\" John's father says. \"They'll be watchin' the door, but we'll cover for you.\" John's mother and sisters move silently about, gathering food and clothes and tying them in a sack. John kisses his mother goodbye and turns to you.||\"There be Maroon towns out in the woods,\" he says with a grin. \"Maroons are runaway slaves livin' free. Come on!\" John's father opens the door, and you all rush out into the night. People whoop and dance and run in every direction. They all carry sacks just like yours, so that in the confusion no one will know which way the real runaways are going.||\"Hurry!\" John says as you plunge through the forest.||\"Will we really be safe with the Maroons?\" you ask when you catch your breath.||\"I hope so. Them Maroons have a leader named Nanny. She's a sorceress! She can see the future. She can catch them bullets in her teeth and throw 'em right back!\"||Off in the distance, you hear a noise. \"Awroo!\"||\"They have dogs after us!\" says John. \"Let's go.\"||You're curious about this Maroon town and about Nanny, but you could jump back in time. How about Port Royal in 1670, when it was a buccaneer capital? It's hard to tell how either choice would get you closer to finding the treasure, so you'll just have to make a guess!">

Come. Nanny will test you. If you are lying, you will die!\" They take you up the narrow path. At the top of the cliff you see a clearing, with grass-roofed huts built in a circle. Runaway slaves have built a village just like the ones they left back in Africa!||The men push you inside one of the huts. A woman with a colored scarf around her head sits with her back to you.

Sometimes you travel like other men. But sometimes\" -- she stares into your eyes -- \"sometimes, the sun comes up. She looks for all her children, but you are gone! What are you searching for? Don't tell me.\"||She closes her eyes, and rocks back and forth. \"I see a ship,\" she says in a strange, high voice. \"A great ship, like the one that brought me from Africa. It is very heavy. In its belly are many stones the color of a white man in his grave. Silver! A storm. The ship hits a reef.\"||\"That's what I'm looking for!\" you say. \"But where is the reef the Concepcion hit?\"||She smiles. \"Let me tell you a story.

Sailors roam the streets, drinking and singing songs with their arms around the waists of women in brightly colored gowns.||\"A toast!\" shouts a sailor. \"To Captain Henry Morgan, leader of the raid on Venezuela that has filled our pockets with gold!\"||\"Yer pockets,\" says a redheaded woman, \"ain't filled anymore, are they?

<CONSTANT TEXT093 "You've been waiting in Pierre's boat for a week now for a ship to pass through the channel north of Hispaniola. You ate the last strip of boucan meat two days before, but Big Pierre refuses to give up.||\"Pierre!\" says one of the buccaneers, \"we have no food! How can we fight if we are weak from starvation?\"||Pierre growls. \"You can't wait to eat the fine food of the Spanish, dog?\" He takes off a pig-skin shoe and throws it to the man. \"There, chew on that!\"||\"Here comes a ship!\" someone says. \"At last.\" On the horizon you see a sail. The men cheer, and they sharpen their knives. Then another ship appears, and another. It's a whole fleet!||\"This is not so good,\" says Pierre. \"They have many guns. A small boat with only twenty-eight men has no chance against a fleet! We will pretend to be fishermen.\" The ships sail on, and soon you can see the people on them. Pierre holds a long pole from the boat's stern, as if he's fishing.||\"They look at us with spyglasses. Everyone smile. Wave! Wave to the pretty ships!\" The dirty, bearded buccaneers all grin with their yellow teeth and wave. One ship turns to come closer.||BOOM! Something splashes in the water a few yards away. Pierre drops his pole.||\"They fire on us! The dogs! Quick, we will hide in the reefs. We are small, the rocks are no problem. The Spanish cannot follow.\"||You turn the boat and row with all your strength. Cannonballs splash all around you. Soon the boat is gliding between jagged chunks of coral. It all looks familiar.||\"Is this the Handkercher Reef?\" you ask.||\"No. The Handkercher Reef is farther to the west. This is another reef, northwest from Samana Bay.\" Hmmm, you think. Very interesting. Maybe the ship went down in this reef, and Captain Phips doesn't know about it.||The fleet sails off to the east, and Pierre brings his boat back into the channel. The sun is going down. You sail southwest, toward the old Spanish ghost town of Isabela on Hispaniola.||\"Well,\" says Pierre, \"our luck is not so good this time. Next year ...\"||\"Don't give up yet, Big Pierre. Look!\" One more ship is coming up the channel. All its sails are out as it struggles to catch up with the fleet.||\"Aha!\" says Pierre. \"Perfect. My partner,\" he says to you, \"take this tool. Drill a hole in the bottom of your boat.\"||\"A hole?\" you ask.||\"Yes. There will be no escape for us! Either we take this Spanish ship or we die. Now, quiet.\"||You do as he tells you. Water trickles in and floods the bottom of the boat. It's dark now. You see lights on the ship above the huge, black hull. You can hear someone laughing on deck. Your boat, rapidly sinking, is so small! How will you ever capture such a big ship? Maybe you should slip over the side of the boat in the darkness and jump in time -- perhaps to Samana Bay, not far away, to wait for Captain Phips.||\"My buccaneers!\" whispers Big Pierre. \"Soon it will be our turn to laugh. But we must be brave. I want you to swear, all of you, a solemn oath. We will fight to the last man. Will you swear?\"||\"Aye,\" whispers each man in turn. You, however, are not so sure you want to join this desperate party.">

You hear singing and the clink of glasses from inside.||\"Count to fifteen,\" whispers Pierre, \"and then whistle. Like a bird.\" He disappears.||You count and then whistle. The guard stands up and peers in your direction. There's Pierre! He slips a cord around the guard's neck and pulls. The guard struggles and slumps to the deck.||\"Now!\" says Pierre. He throws open the door and you rush in. The officers sit there in their underwear, playing cards.||\"Aiee! Jesus bless us! Are these devils, or what are they?\"||\"We are the spirit of revenge!\" cries Pierre. He holds a pistol to the captain's chest. \"Surrender your ship or your life!\"||You hear gunfire and the sound of crossing swords. One of the officers jumps for the door, but a buccaneer runs him through with his blade. Another man runs in, missing an ear.||\"Three men lost, Big Pierre, but the ship's guns are ours!\"||\"What say you, Spanish captain? Are you captain still?\"||\"I -- I -- the ship is yours!\"||You lock the Spanish soldiers up, and the buccaneers man the sails.||The ship contains little silver but many kinds of expensive colored dyes. Pierre decides to sail to his native France to sell them, but you decide to get back on the trail of your own treasure.||On his way to France, Pierre stops at one of the small Virgin Islands. He keeps only as many sailors as he needs and leaves the rest of the Spanish on the island. You take the opportunity to wander off to the woods and jump ahead in time.">

What are you doing here?\"||\"I've been doing research for you, Captain. Now I'm sure I know where the treasure lies!\"||He crosses his arms and looks skeptical. \"You do, eh? Well, let's hear your tale.\"||\"I met a buccaneer,\" you say, \"who sails around here a lot. He told me there's another reef to the east of Handkercher Reef.\"||Phips looks surprised. \"Another reef? It's not on my charts!\"||\"That's not all. Back in the woods here there's a crazy old hermit. He was the pilot of the Concepcion! He went into hiding to keep from being hanged for losing the ship.

Up ahead you see three rocks that look very familiar. \"Let's try up there.\" You paddle closer.||\"Do you see any treasure?\" Rogers asks.||\"No,\" you say, \"no treasure. But I wonder who's been throwing cannons in the water?\"||\"Cannons?\" he cries. \"The ship's guns. We found it!\"||Rogers stays in the boat while you dive. The cannons lie on white sand. The ship has long since rotted away, but you can see the outline of the bow on the sea floor. You can't see any silver, just a lot of black, coral-covered rocks. You have just enough time to grab a couple of these and kick madly up to the air.||\"Hmm,\" Rogers says. \"Funny sort of rock.\" He hits them together. They break apart -- into chunks of silver coins.||\"Yahoo!\" you cry, and dive back into the sea.||It's easier to get the silver now that the ship has rotted away, but diving thirty feet is tiring. You put the silver in a sack and paddle back to the ship. The other searchers are all reporting back. Rogers puts his finger to his lips.||\"Nothing to southwards, Cap'n,\" says one.||\"No luck in our canoe, neither.\"||\"It's got to be here somewhere,\" mutters Phips. He pounds his fist on the table. \"We're going to find it if it takes all summer! How about you, Century?\"||\"We didn't find much,\" you say casually. \"Just this.\" You pull a silver bar out of the sack. Everyone stands staring at it. No one can speak. Then Phips gets down on his knees. You all kneel with him.||\"Merciful God,\" he says quietly, \"we thank thee for blessing thy humble servants with success.\" Then he jumps to his feet.||\"Yahoo!\" Everyone shouts and dances around the room. Phips brings out a keg of brandy, and everyone toasts your health. The captain gives you a hug, tears of joy streaming down his face.||In the next few days, you load hundreds of pounds of silver on the ship. Only the professional divers have the strength to go down that deep, over and over again. They bring up bucketfuls of silver coins, tons of silver bars, spoons, forks, candlesticks, and bowls.||\"My dear friend Century,\" Phips says, \"we owe you so much! You'll be rich when we get back to London. But I'll make you a present now. You may have as much silver as will fit in your knapsack.\"||You choose some nice thick candlesticks as a present for your family.
